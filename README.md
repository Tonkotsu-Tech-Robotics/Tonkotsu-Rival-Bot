## What is it?
Tonkotsu RIVAL Robot is a robot built to play the RIVAL Robotics competition with the intent of running on swerve drive and having a boat hook mechanism that can extend to maximum height of 75" to score badminton (or in this game, missiles) onto towers.

## Why does this mechanism exist in our reality?
